I think Qinghefang Street and Lingyin Temple are all the attractions which let me enjoy myself. Qinghefang Street is one of the most famous and historic streets in the city .And it reflects many of the features of the Southern Song Dynasty. We can admire the antique buildings while purchasing items from a wide range of local goods such as silks, tea or maybe a silk parasol, brocade or a beautiful Hangzhou fan. As I walked along the path of Lingyin Temple, the peaceful environment around calmed me down and filled my heart with leisure and relaxation.
